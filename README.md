# 后记
众所周知，一些家长、老师会在孩子不知情的情况下偷看孩子的通信软件(如ICQ,微信,QQ)以及社交软件(Tumblr,facebook,朋友圈)，    
这是一种不恰当的行为。因为每个孩子的通信自由都值得被尊重，这是每一个孩子（包括我）应有的权利。这种行为在中式教育尤为显著。  
很多老师也会查看学生的通信软件以及设备，这在法律上是被禁止的。人教版《道德与法治》也曾经提到过，公民享有隐私权。  
隐私的保护在于每一个人的努力，并不是口口声声的形式主义。  
一些恬不知耻的人会执意看孩子的通信设备，将违法发挥到了极致。  
所以，我开发了在线聊天平台，(借鉴了很多人的代码)  
旨在让大家少用家长、老师熟悉的平台，以保障学生权益。  
在此希望各位能够提出宝贵意见。  
我们一定会保护每位同学的隐私不受侵犯，  
每一个人的信息安全都应当被注意，  
哪怕只是一个14岁的孩子  

# Foreword
As we all know, some parents and teachers will peep at their children’s communication software (such as ICQ, WeChat, QQ) and social software (Tumblr, facebook, circle of friends) without their children’s knowledge.  
This is a bad behavior. Because every child's freedom of communication deserves to be respected, this is the right of every child (including me). This behavior is particularly significant in Chinese education.  
Many teachers will also check students' communication software and equipment, which is legally prohibited. People's Education Edition "Moral and Rule of Law" also mentioned that citizens have the right to privacy.  
The protection of privacy lies in the efforts of everyone, not the formalism of the voice.  
Some shameless people will insist on looking at their children's communication equipment, to the extreme of illegality.  
Therefore, I developed an online chat platform, drawing on the code of many people.  
It aims to make everyone less familiar with the platform that parents and teachers are familiar with.  
# Principle
The platform is divided into three modules: index.php top.php input.php  
Need to run in PHP environment, the memory footprint is relatively small.

# Postscript  
At the end, I hope you can give your valuable opinions.  
We will protect the privacy of every student from infringement,  
Everyone’s information security should be noted, 
Even if it’s just a 14-year-old child
